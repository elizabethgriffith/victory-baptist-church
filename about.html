								<h3>Who We Are</h3>
								<p>Welcome to our church website. We are so glad you have come to see who we are.  
                                    While we hope that you will come and meet us in person, here are a few things that might help...</p>
								<p>
                                    When you come to our church you might notice that we moved into our own building to worship in...that is true,

                                    we own land and have an office building. We do own a great commercial modular building that we are in, 
                                    still doing work on the building but we are in and glorifying our LORD for all that HE is doing. 
                                    Realizing that the grounds and the structures are tools, the real church are our people.</p>
                                <p>When you come to our church you will notice that there is always a warm smile and a hearty hand shake. 
                                    We DO come to encourage others, carry one another's burdens, rejoice with one another, and our 
                                    leadership lives to equip the believers for all good works in Jesus Christ.</p>
                                <p>When you come you will notice that we are made up of all kinds of people. We believe that the Body of 
                                    Christ isn't justmade up of people that all look alike, dress alike, and think alike. While our members 
                                    do agree on basic doctrine, and the church does uphold the whole of God's Word, we love being as 
                                    different and diverse as God's creation. Each person who comes brings a whole new look to the church - 
                                    but isn't that what it is supposed to be like? Everyone is valuable at VBC, for God has made them 
                                    special.</p>
                                <p>What you should expect is a place to love, serve, honor God, and hear the Word of God preached with 
                                    conviction and truth. The Gift of God in Jesus Christ is the center of our relationship with God - 
                                    so expect to hear about Him every time we meet. HE IS WHY WE COME TO CHURCH!</p>

								<h3>What We Believe</h3>
								<p>Our church is solidly biblical, with all of our beliefs coming from the Word of God. We believe that all 
                                    men and women fall short of the glory of God and that the punishment for those sins is death - BUT, 
                                    Jesus died for our sins to give us life! (Rom 3:23, 5:8, 6:23). </p>
                                <p>Because God created us for fellowship with Him, to bring Him glory, He didn't leave us to die for our 
                                    sins, but desires that we have eternal life!  So, for those who will repent (turn from their sins to 
                                    God), make Jesus their Lord, believe that He came, died, was buried, and rose again on the third day 
                                    according to Scripture, will be saved from their sins when they accept His gift of eternal life through 
                                    faith!  (Rom 10:9-13, Eph 2:8-10). </p>    
                                <p>While our allegiance is to God, we proudly cooperate with the Southern Baptist Convention. We believe 
                                    that their statement of faith reflects our beliefs and that by working together we can better accomplish 
                                    the Great Commission to reach and teach all people.  Our (more complete) statement of faith can be found 
                                    here: </p>    
                                <p>Please let us know if you have specific questions about our beliefs, we would be happy to answer them.</p>  
                                <hr />
