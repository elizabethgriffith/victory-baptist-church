								<h3>Adults</h3>
								<p>Adult Bible Study on Sunday Mornings is the main opportunity to relate to one another, build friendships 
                                    and study the Word of God. It starts at 9:30 am and is taught by either the pastor or one of our very 
                                    qualified Bible teachers in the church.</p>
								<p>Wednesday night Bible study and prayer meeting is also a great time to gather (6:30 pm at the church 
                                    office).  First, we share our prayer needs/requests/and heart (as appropriate and you desire) with a 
                                    smaller group of people and then spend time praying together.  Secondly, we dive a little deeper into 
                                    God's Word as we explore the Bible and come to see the Word of God come to life through very intentional 
                                    and deliberate interactive study.</p>
                                <p>Other opportunities for fellowship and Bible study exist on a rotating basis. Please call for more 
                                    information (623) 386-3240.</p>

								<h3>Youth</h3>
								<p>Our Youth, 7th to 12th Grades, gather every Sunday morning at 9:30 am for Bible Study. They have a 
                                    great time coming to know the God of the Bible and learn how to live for Him in a world that isn't 
                                    always so friendly.</p>
                                <p>The youth are encouraged to bring friends, and they know that their friends will be welcomed.</p>    
                                <hr />

                                <h3>Children</h3>
								<p>Sunday School every week at 9:30 am is a main time of gathering, with qualified teachers who bring the 
                                    kids together around the Word of God. We have classes for children from preschoolers to 6th grade. We 
                                    love our little ones and continually strive to offer them a caring and comfortable first experience at 
                                    church.</p>
                                <p>Vacation Bible School is a yearly event that lasts one week and includes some of the best fun around! 
                                    We care for our children, and look forward to serving them weekly in our very safe and helpful 
                                    setting.</p>    
                                <p>"Train up a child in the way he should go. Even when he is old he will not depart from it." 
                                    Proverbs 22:6</p>    
                                <hr />

                                <h3>Preschool</h3>
								<p>Our kids, under 6, may go to children's church after the children's sermon during morning worship. 
                                    We have a special lesson for them, and a secure place (just a door away from the adults) where they 
                                    may learn and work out some wiggles if necessary.  This area also doubles as a quite and secure place 
                                    where new mothers may find privacy, but still hear the service.</p>
